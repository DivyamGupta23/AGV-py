# Algorithm-Visualiser-python

The Algorithm Visualizer is a Python program designed to help users visualize various searching and sorting algorithms in action. The program presents a graphical representation of the algorithm's operation, allowing users to see how different inputs affect the algorithm's behavior.

The visualizer includes several popular algorithms such as binary search, linear search, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quick sort. Users can select the desired algorithm and enter an input array to visualize the algorithm's operation
